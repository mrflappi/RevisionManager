# RevisionManager
A Revision Manager designed for A-Level students!

You can:
- Add your subjects on a bi-weekly rotation
- Add tasks to complete during any period (or after school)
- Rename, reschedule or delete tasks as you wish
- Auto-reschedule incomplete tasks to later

You can download the latest builds over in the packages section, or you can download the code and make changes if you are a nerd like me.
This project is mostly just to help me with organising my own A-Level work and also because programming random stuff is fun! I don't plan on making it look pretty, it is designed to be functional. Also yes, AI helped me out a bit; Python ain't my first language, sorry not sorry.

### Building
If you downloaded the source code and want to build for Windows, run:
> pyinstaller revision_manager.spec

...and make sure you have the necessary packages installed.
